<h2>
  <p>Fun fact about  <b>myself</b></p>
<p>Assalamualaikum , hi!</p>
<p>My name is Marisya binti Ridzwan , from class BA2403B.
I studied at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UITM) cawangan Kelantan Kampus Kota Bharu
I lived at Kuala Ibai , Kuala Terengganu.
My favourite activities while im free is spend time with beloved family and surfing the internet.
I love listening to rock,pop and romance genre . For the example Kugiran Masdo and The Chainsmokers.</p>
<p>Furthermore,I'm a big fan of adventure movies.It is because this genre gives me danger, excitement, and a meaningful journey for the protagonist.
I enjoy playing sports like badminton and Tennis with my brothers and sister in every evening.It such a theraphy for me when I'm stressed and depressed.
At 2021, i have been to Kota Makkah and Madinah with my beloved family for our Umrah.I really enjoy with the environment and it is so cold .It has given me the strength to face all the challenges I face in the world.
I'm a foodie and i love to trying different types of cuisine , especially in pastries edition.I would like to taste all pastries such as Croissant,Mille-feuille and puff pastry.
I have speacial behaviour that i keep doing until now.it is I am very agitated if I see a homeless person in trouble . I will try to make them happy either in money or in deeds.I love to carve sincere smiles from their faces because everyone deserves to be happy in this world.</p>
<p>Besides,I have a favorite motto that I instill in myself .It is "today we help people, tomorrow others will help us back". I have learned that it is important to be kind to others, whether they are young or old.We do not know when we will be in trouble in the future. be positive. 
In my previous semester, I have volunteered at SMKA Melor , Kota Bharu Kelantan.It involved a total of 61 students of smka melor and all UiTM Kota Bharu students.This program was held to provide awareness,motivation of life and improve social skills in every student. This is very important to apply to them so that they can feel more confident in living a better quality life ,even always being posotive in themselves.
One of my most memorable experiences that I will never forget was going to Legoland,Johor with my family when I was 10 years old . I was the most excited person to play all the rides there . There are 40 rides for example,Dino island,Dragon Apprentice, Aquazone Wave Racers and Technic Twister.It was a great experience playing with my beloved family.
Lastly, i enjoy to exploring nature with my friend.It is because i can gain new knowledge about our nature.
That is a bit about me . </p>
